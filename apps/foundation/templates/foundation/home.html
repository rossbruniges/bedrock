    <h1>The Mozilla Foundation</h1>

    <p>The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes <strong>openness, innovation and participation on the Internet</strong>.</p>

    <p>Mozilla is best known for the <a href="{{ php_url('/firefox/') }}">Firefox</a> browser, but we advance our mission through other software <a  href="{{ url('mozorg.products') }}">projects</a>, <a href="{{ url('grants') }}">grants</a> and engagement efforts such as <a href="https://webmaker.org">Webmaker</a>.</p>

    <p>Although thousands of people are part of Mozilla, the Mozilla Foundation itself is a small team of people. We provide core services to the Mozilla community and promote the <a href="{{ url('mozorg.mission') }}">values of an open Internet</a> to the broader world.</p>

    <p>If you're interested in supporting our efforts, please consider <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/page/contribute/openwebfund">making a donation</a> and <a href="{{ url('mozorg.contribute') }}">getting involved</a> with the Mozilla community.</p>
